            2012 marks the 35th Anniversary of the Chinese Cultural Association of New Brunswick (CCANB).

        <p>
            In 1977, a few Chinese Canadian families established the Chinese Cultural Association and soon started a basement co-op Chinese School for their own children. Since then, more and more Chinese Canadians and immigrants have joined and helped form one of New Brunswick&#39;s largest and most vibrant communities. Our Chinese Language School has since evolved into a multi-functional educational tool with more than 60 students and a center of our community.

            For 35 years, CCANB has contributed significantly to the cultural and educational experiences to the citizens of Fredericton and New Brunswick. It is our continual goal to provide a warm and welcoming environment for our members and all new comers to our community.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is time to celebrate such a milestone, to share the value of our culture and to share our happiness with all of our families and friends. The celebration of both our 35th anniversary with our Chinese New Year Festival will definitely make such an event more exciting!
        </p>
        <p>
            On behalf of CCANB, I would like to thank all of our volunteers for their help of organizing this celebration. Special thanks to the Steering Committee for their hard work. As usual, I strongly believe that the celebration will be a big success that further unites us together and makes us stronger and more prosperous.
        </p>
        <p>
            Together, let&#39;s embrace our future. Together, life is better with CCANB!
