						<p class="eassy_body_e"><strong>Day 1</strong></p>
						<p class="eassy_body_e">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the night of August 18, 2000, Tom, Matt and my dad stayed up until 12 in the morning loading the six canoes onto the trailer. That same day, Tom had built a rack for those canoes with his own hands!</p>
						<p class="eassy_body_e">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next morning, at about 7am, Tom and David came over to make sure every thing was alright. Then we drove to the FHS parking lot to meet the other members of youth group. That morning was freezing. I preferred staying in the warmth of the van, rather than getting out! I later found that many people had stayed up late the night before, packing. The Ng family (Karen and Lisa) had also stayed up late, but for another reason; they found a strange drunk lying on their couch in the livingroom!...But that's another story.</p>
						<p class="eassy_body_e">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After holding a final little meeting (all I can remember was that we decided to camp on the remote site and that there would be no outhouses there...only the good ground and trees...), we loaded the rest of the baggage and people into their respective vehicles. Karen, Jar-Yee and I were all in the van with the trailer holding 6 canoes. Matt was the designated driver for that vehicle.</p>
						<p class="eassy_body_e">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he ride to our departure point in McAdam took about one hour. We unloaded our stuff at the dock and decided who would get which canoe. There was a little disturbance when Sally, Karen and Aleatha got into a minor argument over a canoe. Finally, Sally's stubbornness and persistence won. I would be sharing the canoe with Sally, but personally, I didn't see much of a difference between the canoes, but maybe that's just me.</p>
						<p class="eassy_body_e">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we finally got the canoes loaded and all the stuff tied down, it was about 11:30. Remember how that morning was freezing? Well, I decided to put my fleece on over my tee-shirt and fisherman's vest. On top of that, I had my raincoat (the forecast was rain for that weekend) and my life jacket. As the sun was getting higher and higher, it eventually got hotter and hotter. Finally, I couldn't stand it anymore and unbuttoned everything again and took off my fleece. But I kept my raincoat on under my life jacket just in case in rained! </p>
						<p class="eassy_body_e">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slowly, one by one, the canoes were let out into the water. Sally and I practiced together for a while before everybody was ready to go. We would be canoeing near the far shore of the lake. The weather was perfect and the lake was calm. Up above, the sun was shining brighter than ever and the sky was bright blue with fluffy white clouds. Whatever happened to the RAIN!?!? Did I really buy my raincoat for nothing after all? Eventually, I was forced to take off my raincoat, it was just getting too stuffy in there. </p>
						<p class="eassy_body_e">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We paddled and paddled without much interference. Sally was a good partner and usually, we would be near the front, but sometimes, we slacked off and fell behind.</p>
						<p class="eassy_body_e">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few hours. We came to a place with a little human-made dam. There were many lilies floating in the water nearby and many people picked them. I didn't though...I preferred their natural beauty in the water where they wouldn't whither so fast. Near the dam, Ricmond had discovered a huge dead white fish, about a foot long, floating in the water. It was pretty gross if you weren't prepared to see it.</p>
						<p class="eassy_body_e">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyway, we had to somehow get over the dam, so everybody lined their canoes up near it. The occupants of each canoe would get out and the big strong guys, namely Tom, David, Matt and Vince (I think that's all, sorry if I missed anyone!) picked up the canoes, one at a time and hauled it over the dam. Then, the occupants would have to step carefully onto rocks while pushing and steering the canoe around protruding rocks. The current was pretty fast in this little strait of water. Because of all the uneven, slippery rocks, it was hard to get a sure footing and the whole time, the current was pushing the canoe downstream. Once, I lost my balance while holding onto our canoe, while Matt's canoe sailed by right behind me. There was no room to go and the current was pushing the canoe towards me, so I fell backwards and almost "slid" under our canoe, but I gained my footing again and saved my head from getting wet. I was now soaked from my chest down. I didn't have on my bathing suit and I was still wearing wet jogging pants... not a nice feeling. </p>
						<p class="eassy_body_e">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Going through that passage was a little tricky, but once we got out into open water, it was smooth sailing again. Well, not exactly SAILING, more like paddling like crazy. </p>
						<p class="eassy_body_e">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was another tricky spot after that. We had to go under a bridge and that spot was really rocky. This time, I just got out and pushed because I was already wet. (Last time, Sally pushed first until I was forced to get out and push with her, just to make her feel better.) I had stripped off my soaking wet jogging pants and wore my shorts that were on underneath, so it wasn't too bad this time.</p>
						<p class="eassy_body_e">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All this while, the sun was shining brightly. I had wanted to wear my hat, but it was doubled bagged AND tied with a rope. It was too much trouble to get it out, so I just went without it.</p>
						<p class="eassy_body_e">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyway, after the rocky part, we came to a marshy spot and we saw a big beaver lodge (it IS called a LODGE...you know the teepee thing that the beavers live in...their house! and not a DAM! Trust me, I looked it up.) There were a lot of Canadian geese there as well, resting on the banks. They didn't look too interested in us. Then, we saw the beaver. I saw it appear twice. The first time, it just swam around, checking us out. Then it dove under water. A few minutes later, it reappeared, slapped it's tail on the water and disappeared beneath the wave. I didn't get a chance to see him again.</p>
						<p class="eassy_body_e">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had eaten a granola bar for a snack because I was getting pretty hungry now. It was 3:30 pm we still had not eaten lunch! I was paddling anxiously, round the corner, then round another corner..... Sally was complaining that she was tired now, but I really wanted food, so all I could say was "paddle harder and we'll get there sooner!" I don't know if that motivated her, but sometimes we would get these bursts of energy and chant "One two, One two..." all the while paddling furiously. But then, after a while, we would slow down and sooner or later, the complaining would somehow resurface.</p>
						<p class="eassy_body_e">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I saw a duck in the water, fishing for food a couple of times that day. I'm not sure if it was a loon, I can't remember.</p>
						<p class="eassy_body_e">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, after what seemed like forever, we reached the remote campsite. Tired and hungry as everyone was, nobody objected to staying there for the night. After tying all the canoes up, we unloaded our stuff. One group set up the girls' tent while Vivian and I made the tuna and ham sandwiches for lunch...at 4 o'clock! I don't think I've ever eaten lunch that late before. Aleatha got the fire started with ONE match. It was a good fire from all the drift wood and dry leaves lying around. I think we also had Alphabet soup which I drank without the help of a spoon. (Less dishes to wash!...)</p>
						<p class="eassy_body_e">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After lunch, I think a few people went swimming. I didn't want to get wet again, so I explored a bit of the "beach" and skipped rocks over the lake. Oh! I must also proudly say that I finally learned how to squat and pee. It wasn't as bad as I thought it would be! I can't tell you how glad I am that I have overcome this feat. Never again will I have to worry about going to camp and not having flush toilets or outhouses! Thank you very much!</p>
						<p class="eassy_body_e">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eventually, Chris, Caroline and I went hunting for toads. We found quite a few and even got to hold them in our hands! Poor toads. They even got their pictures taken. While I was "exploring", I saw a small crayfish, or little lobster as I like to call it, in the water, right next to my FEET. I didn't want to catch it with my hands because I didn't want to get pinched. So by the time Chris tried to get it, the little thing had just "jetted" off and we kicked up so much sand, it was impossible to find it again. Caroline had run off to find her camera, so by the time she got back, she had missed all the fun.</p>
						<p class="eassy_body_e">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wanted to get a really nice picture of the sunset over the lake. At one point, the sun's rays were visible as it was filtered through the clouds. It was so nice, but since I only had a limited number of film, I wanted to wait for the redness of the sunset. Chris kept saying "take it now!" and I always responded "A little later." I was worried that perhaps I would wait too long.</p>
						<p class="eassy_body_e">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Supper two hours later was steak which Tom cooked over the stove. I felt sorry for him, cooking all that yummy steak for OTHER people to eat! I ordered my steak medium rare. It looked so good, but when Tom gave it to me, bloody juice started oozing out. It was a bit raw on the inside, so I sent it back to get cooked a bit more. Tom cooked it again, and this time, the outside looked really good. But again, the inside was still not done! So, I chewed off all the cooked meat and left the raw part uneaten and sent it back to Tom. It looked really gross and really chewed up, so I had to wait until he had finished cooking the other two that was already in the pan. This time, after it was yet again cooked, it was edible! Thanks for cooking, recooking and re-recooking my steak Tom! I really appreciated it!</p>
						<p class="eassy_body_e">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By this time, the sun was a bright orange ball in the sky. Chris said "take it now." But fearing that it would be too bright, I again said "A little later." I wanted to get it so that the sun was halfway down the horizon. Finally, a few minutes later, the moment came and I took the picture. 5 seconds later, the sun wet down completely. I hoped it would turn out okay.</p>
						<p class="eassy_body_e">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That night, we roasted marshmallows over the blazing fire. More than eating it, I enjoyed burning them to charcoal. That was fun. I was having a good time, until a certain person by the name of S A L L Y , got marshmallow on my fleece shirt AND my hair. It was pretty gross and very sticky. I tried to get it out but that was almost impossible. My shirt would have to wait until I got home to be washed. Jar-Yee helped me wash my hair with a bit of water from my water bottle. After that, I tried to stay far away from anyone who happened to have a stick of marshmallow. It was ironic that last weekend on our camping trip to Fundy, my friend had gotten marshmallow in MATT'S hair...now this was my turn, except Matt's was much easier to wash out because his hair was short. :P</p>
						<p class="eassy_body_e">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All evening, I was trying to find someone who had floss because I had a piece of steak stuck between two molars and it was really uncomfortable. This was the first time that I HADN'T brought floss with me on a trip. Anyway, while everyone was relaxing around the campfire Tom yells "Who was the one who wanted dental floss?!?!" Right away, it seemed like everybody yelled back "SEPHORA!!" and pointed at me. Gee, how did word spread so quickly?? I only asked a FEW people! But I got the floss and I felt much better afterwards. Thanks again Tom.</p>
						<p class="eassy_body_e">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had planned on going to bed early. So at around 10 or 11pm, I went to our "room" in the nine person tent with Lisa and just talked, trying to fall asleep. Everybody was still talking outside, so I gave up sleeping and went out with Lisa to the rock where David, Y.C., Chris, Caroline, Karen, Fei, Ricmond and Matt were all looking at the stars. The sky still had some clouds, but there was one batch of stars in the sky and further out, by itself, there was a strange twinkling star that might not even have been a star.....</p>
						<p class="eassy_body_e">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I stayed there for hours, just listening to the loon calls and staring at the sky. It was great! You don't normally get this experience in Fredericton where I live! Eventually, Lisa got bored and went back to sleep in the tent. I saw two shooting stars that night. That was so cool! After a while, only Chris, Caroline, Karen and I were left on the rock. Caroline and Karen left and I said I'd go in 5 more minutes. Then, another 5 minutes....somehow, an hour passed and I finally left and was about to go to sleep when I noticed Ricmond, Jar-Yee and Matt were still sitting around the dying campfire. So Chris and I decided to join them. We talked for about an hour and finally at almost 2 in the morning, I decided to go to sleep. So much for getting to sleep early! The other 3 stayed there talking well into the night. All the girls in my tent were already fast asleep and I had no trouble joining them. Now that I think of it, how on earth did I manage to sit there for so many hours looking at the sky???....</p>
						
						<p class="eassy_body_e"><strong>Day 2</strong></p>
						<p class="eassy_body_e">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I woke in the morning at around 8am. Most of the other girls were still sleeping I think, so I just laid in my sleeping bag. I was actually quite comfortable; it wasn't too hot, and it wasn't too cold. I was surprised when other people said they were really cold that night. Finally at 9am, I got up. The lake was very still and calm that morning because there was no wind at all. The reflection of the shoreline in the water was as smooth as glass. It was picture perfect. </p>
						<p class="eassy_body_e">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Breakfast consisted of eggs and bacon which the Duke of Edinburgh girls (Caroline, Karen and Fei) prepared for us. For the eggs, Matt had fashioned an ingenious wooden spatula out of a piece of firewood. Mmmmm...yummy eggs and bark.... Later, the spatula was added to the fire.</p>
						<p class="eassy_body_e">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While cooking the eggs, Caroline decided to add a little salt, except by accident (or was is an accident?...mmm..joking, just joking...) she somehow dumped the WHOLE container right into the pan. So now we have yummy eggs, bark and an overload of salt. But it wasn't so bad after they cracked a few more eggs and mixed it all up! The bacon took a really long time to cook, but when it was done, it was pretty good.</p>
						<p class="eassy_body_e">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometime after breakfast, Matt and Chris had a canoe race with Caroline and Sally. I was sort of watching from the window in the tent. Everyone was cheering them on. Y.C. snapped some really good pics of the action. Guess who won? The girls of course! It was a shameful moment for the guys...</p>
						<p class="eassy_body_e">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the big race, all the girls decided to go in for a swim. At first, I didn't want to go and get cold and wet, but seeing that everybody else was already in, I didn't want to miss out on anything. After a while, some of the guys (Matt, Chris and Ricmond) decided to join us. We splashed around for a while and had our pictures taken. Then, Matt had the bright idea of swimming out to the big rock farther out, where Vince and Vivian were already relaxing.</p>
						<p class="eassy_body_e">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, the whole group of us headed out. Some people brought life-jackets (the just-in-case thing). A pool length before the big rock, we arrived at a smaller rock where we decided to stop and take a break. After a while, we decided to get moving again. I happened to arrive first at the big rock. The wind seemed to be picking up a just a bit. Sooner or later, everybody arrived and we just sat there shivering. I was all prepared to swim back, (because I was just FREEZING) when Y.C. decided that he wanted to take a picture of us out there, so we had to stay put while he paddled out with his camera. Matt was smart, he put on a life-jacket to keep warm. After what seemed like a very long time, the pictures were taken and I headed back to shore with Jar-Yee right behind me. The boys and especially Ricmond stayed on the rock. Poor Ricmond was like "I'm too cold to swim back!...Tell them to send a canoe out to get us!" Hee hee....</p>
						<p class="eassy_body_e">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On my way back, I stopped at the little rock again before swimming all the way back. In the end, I finally arrived at the shore without any help whatsoever! The boys on the other hand....well, hee hee, Ricmond got a free ride back in a canoe, while Matt and Chris hung on to the sides. Now THAT'S sad. What was wrong with the guys that morning?!? First they lost the canoe race, and now they can't even swim back when all the other girls did!!!</p>
						<p class="eassy_body_e">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dave got a really nice fire going for us. I thought I would get dry pretty quick, but only the outside of my bathing suit got dry, the inside was still damp. As the wind was really picking up now, I was still freezing even thought the fire was blazing in front of me. At one point, I tried to pour a capful of peroxide onto a cut on Lisa's foot, but I couldn't pour it right because my hand was shaking so bad from the cold! It felt like I was having a mini seizure! I finally decided to change into some dry clothes and I felt much better afterwards. </p>
						<p class="eassy_body_e">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I proceeded to burn a couple more marshmallows until Aleatha roasted the perfect one for me and put it between two graham crackers. I put in half a piece of Belgian chocolate that Lisa had given me and gave the other half to Aleatha to reward her for her good work. The resulting smore was delicious! </p>
						<p class="eassy_body_e">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it was around noon when we packed up our stuff and was getting ready to go. The sky was now dark with grey clouds. It started to sprinkle a little so I got my raincoat out. </p>
						<p class="eassy_body_e">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jar-Yee, Chris, and Matt got theirs out too. Since we all bought the same ones, we looked like quadruplets!</p>
						<p class="eassy_body_e">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we started to leave, it was starting to really rain. Our plan was to paddle to the bridge and get picked up there. After paddling for a few minutes, we heard thunder. I thought when you heard thunder, you're suppose to GET OUT of the water. I asked Vince, but he said there wasn't much we could do. It wouldn't be any better pulling over to the swampy lands, so all we really could do was just keep paddling! </p>
						<p class="eassy_body_e">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was a good point, so all I was thinking now was paddle harder and please please don't tip now!</p>
						<p class="eassy_body_e">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the time we neared the beaver lodge, it was pouring so hard, it was hard to see. Good thing I wore contacts because the people with glasses had to take them off to see better! My pants were soaked but I thought that at least my butt would stay dry because I was sitting. I forgot that the seat was molded with a butt shape, so when I shifted my position a little, all the rain water ran down the sides of the seat and yes, got my butt wet. :P I again did not wear my bathing suit...</p>
						<p class="eassy_body_e">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We saw the Canadian geese again and even some ducklings, but with all the rain, I didn't really stop to admire them. I just wanted to get to shore fast!</p>
						<p class="eassy_body_e">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, we arrived at the bridge. I got out and helped steer the canoe to shore. I was following Ricmond's lead. He was in the water and pushing too. In one spot, the water was a little below his waist. I thought, that's not too deep....But I forgot that he is much taller than me. The water suddenly went a little higher than my waist! Shoot! </p>
						<p class="eassy_body_e">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, anyway, we got the canoe on shore and proceeded to untie and unload everything. It was still raining hard and windy too. Tom told everybody that was cold to get in Y.C's van which was waiting for us. Miraculously, I wasn't cold, except for my legs because they were wet. But my upper body was pretty dry, so at least I wasn't shivering. I think it was thanks to all the layers of clothes that I wore: tee-shirt, fleece, vest, life-jacket (they're pretty warm!) and raincoat! Thank goodness for my raincoat! It came in handy after all!</p>
						<p class="eassy_body_e">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After most of the stuff was unloaded, I went to join the group of people that were all huddled together under the green tarp that Matt had brought. The drivers had gone back with Y.C. to pick up their vehicles. They would come back to get the rest of us later.</p>
						<p class="eassy_body_e">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tarp was pulled down around us, so it trapped in a lot of body heat. Thank goodness for body heat! With everybody huddled close like in a group hug, I think most of us stayed pretty warm. Dave went back and forth from his canoe to the tarp, passing out dry articles of clothing because a lot of people were soaked. He was only wearing a wet tee-shirt and shorts, so when he offered his emergency blanket that could only warm one person, we wrapped him in it! I was actually pretty warm in there, so I thought this was quite fun....just like real survival! </p>
						<p class="eassy_body_e">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seemed like we were huddling there for a very long time, but finally the drivers came back. I went to my van and the heat was turned on full blast. Jar-Yee, Dave, Chris, Jeff, Karen, Matt and I all waited in the van while Tom went back to get his truck. We were the lucky ones because all the food was in our van!</p>
						<p class="eassy_body_e">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After another long wait, Tom's truck came back. We loaded all the luggage into the vehicles and the guys loaded the 6 canoes back onto our trailer. Jar-Yee told me some ranger guy from Environment Canada stopped by to give us a bunch of pens and badges I think. I didn't know what was going on because I had dozed off for 15 minutes. I woke up just in time to see the ranger leave.</p>
						<p class="eassy_body_e">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon, everything was loaded and we headed back. We stopped in McAdam because I think some people were hungry. I didn't really care where we ate, here or back at home, but I knew one thing, I really really needed to go pee! So, I ran into the restaurant that we had stopped in front of and asked the lady there if there was a washroom I could use. I must have looked like a wreck, but I didn't really care at that point. After I relieved myself, I looked into the mirror and my face was very red like Karen had kept telling me. I don't know if it was a sunburn or from standing too close to the fire....</p>
						<p class="eassy_body_e">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I walked out, the whole youth group was invading the restaurant. Did everybody else have to go pee too? Then I found out we were staying there to eat supper. That was fine with me, but in the end, the bill came to something like $150 for all of us! A lot of people took the opportunity to change into drier clothes. I changed into Lisa's damp track pants that she let me borrow because I didn't have anymore dry pants. They were still better than my soaking wet pants anyway!</p>
						<p class="eassy_body_e">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We left for Fredericton at around 8 pm and arrived at 9 or something like that. Everybody went to Jar-Yee's house to collect their stuff. We had so much food left over it wasn't funny. Matt and I took home a few cans of soup, bread and cold-cuts to help Jar-yee out.</p>
						<p class="eassy_body_e">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All in all, the canoe trip was quite an experience and a success. I'm sure everybody had a great time, I certainly did! Many thanks to Tom, Vince, David, Matthew, and members of the youth group executive for their hard work in organizing and putting together the trip. It couldn't have happened without you. Also, thanks to Y.C., the designated photographer. I'm sure the fantastic pictures that you took will keep the memories of this great trip alive for many many years!</p>
