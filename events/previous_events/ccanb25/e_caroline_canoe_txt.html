						<p class="eassy_body_e">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The day had finally come!  I was going camping with my Chinese school youth group.  So many things on the trip made it an unforgettable experience, but I guess the best place to start is at the beginning.</p>
						<p class="eassy_body_e">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all met at the Fredericton High School parking lot at 8:00 in the morning on August 19, 2000.  After some last minute sorting out of people and bags, we were given some brief introductions to Vince, Vivian, and David.  Tom, the main leader and organizer of the trip, worked with both Vince and David, so he invited them along.  Vivian was Vince's teenage daughter.</p>
						<p class="eassy_body_e">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We arrived at the dock in McAdam at about 10:00 that morning.  We unloaded bags and other equipment from the 4 vehicles, and were assigned canoes despite some minor squabbling on who would use which canoe.  I was canoe partners with my dad, assigned to our own canoe.  Then, all of the vehicles were driven to the more southern campsite of the two at Spednic National Park.  We would be staying at the other one - the one where you didn't have to pay (of course).</p>
						<p class="eassy_body_e">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the time all the drivers had come back to the dock in Tom's car, almost everyone had made a trip to the washroom, and everything we had brought was distributed to every canoe.  Tom showed us how to tie our bags down to the canoe with rope, and soon we all set off at about 11:30.  My dad and I were the last to leave the dock, because my dad was too occupied with taking photographs.  In fact, by the end of the trip, he would have taken 3 rolls of film.</p>
						<p class="eassy_body_e">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The weather was beautiful, and it complimented the gorgeous scenary.  The water was still, or even flowing slightly with the boats, so it was a very enjoyable paddle.  We took a couple short breaks, one during which Jeff and Yong-Bai threw candy into the canoes of people who wanted any.  Throughout the paddle, I saw many things I would have never been able to experience in the city of Fredericton, including seeing Canada Geese, ducks, an eagle and its nest, beavers and their lodge, and old water dam, white lotus flowers, and lilipads.  It was really great.</p>
						<p class="eassy_body_e">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Approximately 3/4 of the way through the paddle, we came to the end of the lake.  Rocks and rapids seperated us from the next lake and a smooth paddle.  So, we had the stronger of the guys, namely Tom, Vince, David, and Matt help us lift the canoes onto the rocks and onto the rock-filled, shallow water on the other side.  I helped hold onto the canoes of people who had yet to make their way over the rocks.  Tom and Vince told us to have one partner sit in the canoe and the other walk through the water to guide it.  Several canoe partners were ahead of us and I could see people struggling and falling into sometimes chest-high water.  Still, I was looking forward to the experience of trying to guide our canoe through.  My dad guided the canoe from the water while I sat inside, but there came a few difficult areas where I was needed to help push the canoe with him.  When we had finally gotten through the 200m of walking through water, it was already a slightly unfamiliar feeling to have the canoe move so smoothly in the water.  We had arrived at the next lake, and it didn't take too long to reach its other end.  </p>
						<p class="eassy_body_e">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We then arrived at Diggity Stream.  There, we reached more shallow water and more rocks, which meant only one thing - get into the water and push again.  Alright!  When the water was deep enough for us to re-enter the canoe, we had reached a bridge.  Past it was the rest of the winding stream.  It seemed frustrating because of the detour we were taking going around all that land when the distance from the bridge to our campsite was so short.  It was about 3:45, and we still hadn't had lunch.  Then, words of encouragement like 'the faster we get there, the sooner we eat' came from behind me so we used the rest of our energy to paddle our way to the campsite.  We arrived at 4:15 that afternoon.</p>
						<p class="eassy_body_e">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The site was snug as a bug in a rug.  It fit all the tents nicely, and there were woods in the back.  There was a small beach near the water which rose slightly leading to the harder ground where we camped  When we arrived, we pulled our canoes on land and tied them to trees.  The tents were then put up and people got settled in.  The girls' tent was the biggest tent I'd ever slept in.  It was 4-room, 8-person tent.  There were even rooms!</p>
						<p class="eassy_body_e">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lunch was next at about 5:00.  Sephora and Vivian made ham and tuna sandwiches.  They were some of the best sandwiches I'd ever had in my entire life because I was so hungry.    There was also vegetable soup and crackers.  We ate while collecting firewood and making the fire.  Aleatha only needed one match to get it going.  David, however, really got the fire going afterwards.  He was later named the 'Fire Specialist.'</p>
						<p class="eassy_body_e">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Afterwards, we cleaned up and washed the dishes.</p>
						<p class="eassy_body_e">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Going the washroom was particularly. . . interesting.  Vivian had found a toilet in the woods, but it was just a box with a toilet seat on top.  Plus, it smelled bad and a lot of bugs were around.  So, we just opted for going behind a tree.  We brought company to be on the lookout, then we took turns going.  It was great fun.</p>
						<p class="eassy_body_e">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At around 6:30, some of the girls went swimming while I went along the beach and explored with Chris and Sephora.  They both found a lot of frogs, but I hadn't found one myself the entire trip.  We also saw a crayfish, but it disappeared in the water quickly.  After some more exploring and skipping some rocks, we returned.</p>
						<p class="eassy_body_e">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Karen and I then decided to go canoeing, so we set off.  We got to where Sally and Aleatha were swimming.  Suddenly, we heard someone say "Flip them over! Flip them over!"  We both shouted "NO!" but they kept on rocking the canoe back and forth.  Then, Sally rocked the boat upwards while Aleatha tried to get in, and the boat tipped.  Karen and I were completely soaked, and my dad thought it was a great photo opportunity.  Thanks, dad.  Aleatha stills insists she didn't mean to tip the boat.</p>
						<p class="eassy_body_e">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We began to cook supper at around 8:30.  We ate steak, potatoes, and vegetables.  Tom cooked the steak, and although many of us had to return our steaks several times because they were undercooked, he did a good job by the end, so thanks Tom!  The potatoes were already cooked so we heated them up putting them in the fire.  Then, we made a vegetable stir-fry using the oil they had used to cook the beef.  Maybe that wasn't the best idea, but I thought they turbed out well despite other opinions.  There was also juice made with the water that we had filtered from the lake.  The filter was simply a pump and two small hoses.  Water was hand-pumped in, filtered, then came out the other end.  I thought that thing was so cool.</p>
						<p class="eassy_body_e">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After dinner, it was already quite dark.  So, the rest of the food was placed in anchored canoes in the middle of the water so that bears wouldn't get to it.  Also, dirty dishes were put in a garbage bag and tied high on a tree.</p>
						<p class="eassy_body_e">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the time everything was done, it was around 10:30.  We sat around the fire for a while, chatting and eating marshallows and other snacks.  We then went to sit on a big rock near the water.  Shortly after, some people went to bed and the fire was put out.  This cleared our view of the beautiful sky, and we just sat there for over an hour, staring at it.  It was becoming cold, but we were all sitting so close together it was alright.  We discussed the many things we saw, like what the clouds looked like to us, and what that bright flashing light over on the right was.  We thought we had found the North Star and the Big Dipper, but I think we were wrong.  I was shown the actual Big Dipper as I got up to go to bed later.  We also saw many more airplanes as the night progressed, and I saw the first shooting star of my life.  </p>
						<p class="eassy_body_e">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from seeing things, we also heard a lot while sitting there.  We heard bird calls, and we tried to get everyone to be quiet several times for a few minutes so we could sit silently, just listening.  Later, we also heard people laughing and shouting in the distance.  My dad also told us an ancient Chinese myth on how one of the constellations was formed.  Two lovers had been seperated, and could only meet once a year.  By the end of the story I was actually feeling bad for the two stars.</p>
						<p class="eassy_body_e">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Karen and I wanted to go to sleep at midnight, but Sephora asked us to stay for five minutes so she could join us to bed.  We did, but the five minutes turned into half an hour and we left the rock at around 12:30 that night.</p>
						<p class="eassy_body_e">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We prepared for bed, and went to sleep at about 1:00.  The last of the campers went to bed at around 3:00 in the morning.  </p>
						<p class="eassy_body_e">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That night, I was cold in my sleeping bag despite the fact that I was wearing a t-shirt under a sweatshirt under a big fleece jacket.  I woke up several times that night, and tried to warm my nose that had practically frozen.  However, my sleep was decent and I woke up at 8:30 the next morning to the sounds of Tom discussing the temperature of the water he had just swam in.</p>
						<p class="eassy_body_e">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Breakfast started at 9:00.  We first cut the leftover potatoes from the night before into hash brown pieces.  Those were heated up and served first.  Then, we made eggs using a piece of wood Matt had found as a spatula.  Everything was going well until I spilled the entire container of salt into the eggs, thinking that there was a shaker over the top.  I still feel bad about that - sorry you guys!  Tom helped us out by distributing the salty eggs throughout the next batches, but they still came out salty.  We fried the bacon, then cleaned up.</p>
						<p class="eassy_body_e">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Afterwards at 10:30, I went canoeing with Sally.  Chris and Matt were already out in the water paddling.  We decided to race even though I wasn't too confident on racing two guys.  However, once we heard the word 'go', Sally and I were off and we pulled ahead of the other canoe.  We got encouragement from the shore, and with that we were the first to reach the finish line.  I was so surprised, but I later realized that our boat was lighter and therefore could go faster.  Still, the glory of a victory for the female race felt good.  Later on, Karen and Aleatha raced Jeff and Yong-Bai and won as well!</p>
						<p class="eassy_body_e">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At 11:00, we all went swimming in the lake.  We hung around one area for a while, then decided we would take the challenge of swimming to a rock down the lake.  It wasn't too far, but we had to stop at a rock in the middle for a rest.  Vince and Vivian were already on the farther rock when we reached it, so they made room for us.  It soon got very cold just sitting there so we returned to the water.  My dad and Jeff soon came on a canoe to take pictures and rescue some people who didn't want to swim back.  They rescued only boys.  I guess the girls really ruled the world that day!</p>
						<p class="eassy_body_e">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At 12:30, we snacked while warming and drying up by the fire that David had just gotten going again.  We then cleaned ourselves up and changed into dry clothes.</p>
						<p class="eassy_body_e">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By 1:30, we were packing our things, cleaning up, and putting down the tents.  When everything was packed up, we loaded into the canoe.  We were especially careful not to leave anything behind, so we checked the campsite thoroughly.  </p>
						<p class="eassy_body_e">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plan had originally been to continue the way we came, but the current was moving the opposite way and the weather wasn't looking favourable, so it was decided that we would return the way we came.  My dad would drive the car and meet us at the bridge.  So, when it came time to leave, Vince paddled my dad across to the other side of the lake.  My dad then hiked about half an hour through the woods to the other campsite where his car was parked.  Meanwhile, I was left without a canoe partner so I was tied to the back of Matt and Jaryee's canoe.  We left the campsite, but Tom soon realized that me behind their canoe wasn't working.  So, I was tied onto Tom and David's canoe.  I still paddled, but steering was much easier.</p>
						<p class="eassy_body_e">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Very soon after that, it started to rain.  Luckily, people who had brought their rainjackets had put them on before leaving the campsite.   I was also relieved that we had wrapped all our things in at least 2 or 3 garbage bags for waterproofing.  Still, the rain made everything so much more exciting.  It continued for maybe 10 minutes when all of a sudden it began to downpour.  The water came down so hard it hurt my legs.  I couldn't see much because of the water coming down and the water bouncing back up from the lake.  All I could hear was the water banging down on the lake.  Tom turned around to me and shouted something I couldn't hear, so I just shouted back and said I was having a great time.  By the last stretch of water before reaching the bridge, the water level in the canoe had reached my ankles.  So, I started bailing water out even though it seemed like there was just as much water left in the canoe when I had stopped bailing.</p>
						<p class="eassy_body_e">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, we had reached the bridge at around 4:00 that afternoon.  I had gotten into the water to pull up my canoe, and found that it was so warm!  I was glad to see our car waiting for us there.  Anyone who needed to get warm quickly was put into the car.  While my dad drove the drivers to get their cars from the other campsite, 15 of us kept warm under a tarp that Matt and Jaryee had used to cover their equipment while it was raining.  It was a small space for 15 people to fit under, so we were all very close together and the body heat helped a lot.  David, who actually just had a t-shirt on, left the tarp a couple times to get dry clothes and an emergency blanket so we could warm up.  We were all completely soaked and some of us were even shaking from the cold, but I was still having a great time.  We all just stood there bunched together until the cars came about 20 minutes later.</p>
						<p class="eassy_body_e">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I rushed to our car right away, eager to take advantage of any car-heating system.  After everyone piled in for a few minutes of heat, we all ran outside to carry the equipment and bags at the canoes over to the cars.  Once the bags were in one big pile, we all went into our own cars to get back to the heat.  Vince had driven Tom to get his car at the dock where we first arrived, so we waited for them for a long time.  Meanwhile, we listened to the radio and ate the food we had been able to bring to the van from Matt's car - the car with all the coolers.  Tom finally arrived after many granola bars, chips, and a lot of trail mix.</p>
						<p class="eassy_body_e">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all then began loading the bags into the vehicles, taking a few seconds in between to warm back up in the car, then returning out in the rain.  That did not take long, so we were soon in the car again watching the guys load the canoes back onto the vehicles.  We made faces outside, and that's when we noticed that David looked a lot like Tom Cruise!</p>
						<p class="eassy_body_e">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At about 6:00 that evening, we left.  By then, our van was muddy and wet, inside and out, and our trunk was stuffed with garbage bags and lifejackets.  We drove, and arrived at Annie's Diner in a short time.  It was a good thing too because quite a few of us were in need of a washroom by then.</p>
						<p class="eassy_body_e">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all ordered either fish & chips or chicken fingers to eat, and many of us changed into drier clothes while we waited for the food.  I never appreciated garbage bags as much as I did then, because they had kept my clothes dry so I was able to change back into warm clothes.  We left at about 7:00 for Fredericton after the filling dinner.</p>
						<p class="eassy_body_e">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The drive back went fine despite some swaying of the trailer that held the canoes behind Matt's car.  The seat I was in had become thoroughly wet by the time we reached Fredericton at around 8:00.  </p>
						<p class="eassy_body_e">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all gathered at Jaryee's house to unload everything and to warm up.  We carried everything into her garage then went inside.  We drank hot chocolate while Jaryee tried to persuade us to take home part of the leftover food.  People left one-by-one, whenever their drive came or whenever they wanted to leave.  I left at 9:00 that night.</p>
						<p class="eassy_body_e">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I got home and helped my dad lower (or drop) the canoe from the van.  Tom had come shortly after to see if we had needed help, but we were pretty much settled.  I unpacked (and hung out to dry) most of my things.  I went to bed with happy canoe thoughts.</p>
						<p class="eassy_body_e">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even though I haven't been on many camping trips, that was definitely the best one I had ever taken.  I was able to experience many aspects of nature that I would have otherwise been unable to in Fredericton.  It was definitely a refreshing break from my normal life .  I am grateful to anyone who helped organize the trip, and to all the people who went that helped make it so enjoyable.  I look forward to going next year, where we can all huddle under a piece of plastic and freeze our asses off again!</p>
						<p class="eassy_body_e">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THANKS A LOT FOR A GREAT TRIP, TOM!!!</p>
