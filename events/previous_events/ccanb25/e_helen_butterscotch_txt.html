						<p class="eassy_body_e">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few years ago, I walked into my first Calculus class at the University of Toronto and sat down in a seat near the back. I was a little early, so I could observe the trickle of students into this sleepy afternoon class. To my amazement, the class was made up almost exclusively of Oriental students with the exception of two blond-haired jocks who also sat at the back. I had grown up in a sleepy little city called Fredericton, and I was unaccustomed to this lack of distinction for being Chinese. Later on, I looked through the University of Toronto student directory to find that there were more Wongs registered than Smiths. This sense of racial anonymity both belittled me and awakened me to the culture conflicts of the second generation Chinese.</p>
						<p class="eassy_body_e">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would often be asked if I was a CBC by my fellow Chinese students. “No.” I would always say. “I am not affiliated with the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation.” However, I soon realized that CBC also stood for Canadian Born Chinese. Moreover, there is more to being a CBC than what meets the almond shape eyes. In fact, technically, I am not a CBC because I was born in Taiwan. I have grown up in Canada and, therefore, I speak better English than Chinese, brave cold weather, comprehend the game of hockey, boogie to Bryan Adams, laugh at the antics of Bob and Doug MacKenzie, and hang-out with non-Chinese friends. All these qualify my CBC status.</p>
						<p class="eassy_body_e">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To make this game of cultural subtleties even more complicate, there is another group of Chinese students on campus known to the CBCs and the FOBs (standing for Fresh Off the Boat). These students are usually visa students, predominantly from Hong Kong. This group also has the distinction of having the loudest voices in campus libraries. Perhaps there is something about speaking Cantonese that forces one to raise one’s voice. This phenomenon is also observed on the Spadina bus to Chinatown.</p>
						<p class="eassy_body_e">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My experiences at the University of Toronto have shown me that through Chinese-Canadians come in all shapes, sizes, and degrees of westernization, they only come in one colour: yellow. Culturally, a Chinese-Canadian is like butterscotch ripple ice cream- each flavour is distinct but both are mixed so they can be tasted together. Second generation Chinese are really a distinct group in search of culture; that is to say, they really don’t know how much butterscotch or vanilla to use to make ice cream. The environment says to be Canadian eh? But how does being Chinese fit into that? I think many CBCs grapple with this question. In the search of the happy medium, some have more vanilla and some have more butterscotch, but it always comes out in ripples. </p>
						<p class="eassy_body_e">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Western and Eastern cultures are so different that it is hard to blend them. Western culture applauds the individual spirit (yet we are all guided by the trends set by the gurus of fashion and the latest pop star). Western culture is like a sucking vortex, once sucked in you lose your sense of being Chinese and you become a banana- yellow on the outside but white on the inside. Chinese culture, on the other hand, is family oriented and strips away individualism. It is an umbilical cord embracing those in the Chinese family and often leaving others out (how many Chinese parents would like Chinese in-laws?). And so, there is a culture conflict for the CBC, second generation Chinese, or whatever you prefer. The environment set up by Western culture says to do what “feels right” for you and for your Chinese family says do what “is right” for us.</p>
						<p class="eassy_body_e">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second generation Chinese may be concerned with culture conflicts. But what about the third, fourth, fifth or will there be a fifth? What will happen to the butterscotch ripples?
