						<p class="eassy_body_e">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am 23 years old and a medical intern in Halifax. I won’t bore you with the usual medical shop talk that tends to come from interns. Besides, you can buy The House of Gods by Samuel Shern in the bookstore and read about it.</p>
						<p class="eassy_body_e">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I would really like to do is to address the concerns of a second generation Canadian-Chinese. To me, the term “Canadian-Chinese” is much more appropriate than “Chinese-Canadian” because I consider myself Canadian first and Chinese second (although grammatically it may be otherwise).</p>
						<p class="eassy_body_e">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being Canadian-Chinese is not something that I have thought very deeply about in the past, I’ve grown up with Canadian children - played in sandboxes, ridden my bike, played in wading pools, gone to school, graduated and even gone out with them. I consider myself one of “them”.</p>
						<p class="eassy_body_e">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The extent to which I have become one of “them” dismays my parents at times. My father calls me a “banana” (someone who is yellow on the outside and white on the inside). Now, this isn’t entirely complimentary, I know, but unfortunately it’s all too true.</p>
						<p class="eassy_body_e">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that, in my adolescent days, I tried to ignore the fact that I was a Chinese. Being Chinese meant that you were different from the others and most children don’t like to be singled out from his/her peers. Kids are cruel, and behaving according to Oriental customs could make you the subject of ridicule. </p>
						<p class="eassy_body_e">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have grown up a bit since then. Puberty was tough, but I survived (20 lbs heavier though). I still haven’t seen or experienced much of the world. However, I feel much more secure with my own identity; and being what I am, I have come to the realization that it’s O.K. to be Chinese and it’s O.K. to be different from other Canadians.</p>
						<p class="eassy_body_e">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think in many respects, its been tougher on my parents. I mean who are these strange creatures living under their roof who can’t even understand Mandarin, let alone speak it? It’s like living with aliens, only worse- you don’t have to feed and clothe visitors from outer space.</p>
						<p class="eassy_body_e">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, parents of the second generation Canadian-Chinese are special people. They put up with a lot and I want to thank all of them, especially my own parents.</p>
						<p class="eassy_body_e">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What concerns me is what the future holds. I am uncertain as to when the baby bananas will be coming along. My mother keeps hinting that they should be falling off the tree soon before I become over-ripe. What will happen to the children of “bananas” ? Who knows? I do know one thing: I would like them to retain, at least, some of their Oriental heritage. We are an ancient culture of hard-working survivors and have much in which to take pride of.</p>
						<p class="eassy_body_e">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a matter of fact, just writing this makes me want to take to the Mandarin language again. What a shame that I have forgotten so much of it. It’s never too late to re-establish those old roots. If I remember any Mandarin, I would conclude this essay with something appropriate; but, since that’s not the case, “c’est tout fini” will do.</p>
