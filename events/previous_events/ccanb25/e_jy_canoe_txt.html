						<p class="eassy_body_e">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We're back for another trip..! Another trip, means more planning..so here we go..!</p>
						<p class="eassy_body_e">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since most of the executives were away for the summer, it fell into my hands to start preparing for our much anticipated trip..with Tom away, everything was kind of confusing..where were we to get the canoes, the paddles, the life jackets, vehicles, tents, how many people were going...the list goes on..! Finally, most of the executives returned and we held out four/five hour meeting to discuss everything..wow..a lot to think about! </p>
						<p class="eassy_body_e">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the day we were waiting for all summer arrived..Friday, August 24th. I woke up at 5:30am (which was reeeally early considering the phone was still ringing off the hook about "we're missing 15 paddles!! Ahh..." or "Do YOU have this??"..)..first thing I headed for was a nice hot shower...the best thing to wake me up in the morning! After packing everything in the cooler, putting ice in the proper places..we set out to Matt and Sephora's house. When I arrived, some of the Malaysian Students were already sitting there waiting..Matt's dad was outside as well, and Sephora was upstairs in her room doing some last minute stuff. Anyway, after a while, we found out that we were going to be delayed for a few hours, so we tried to round everyone up to my house. YC and Jit Chien were going to go to FHS and redirect people.</p>
						<p class="eassy_body_e">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone was at my house by about 9am, luckily, Ricmond called me at home and we figured out where most of them were hiding (inside FHS- who would have thought to look there..???!!?). Some of us decided to play some board games, some decided to watch The Matrix, Caroline and Lisa decided to get some sleep, while SOME PEOPLE wanted to play TORTURE the hamster!! :P</p>
						<p class="eassy_body_e">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while of just doing nothing, Chien Ee, Jit Chien and I decided to try and stuff some gear into their van..that worked pretty well. Angeline's vehicle and MSS Neon Vehicle had been at the Tang's house getting a canoe loaded onto their roof, and when they finished (Sephora called us about once every hour to keep us updated..so we asked her to send them over since they weren't doing anything over there) we started to stuff stuff into THEIR vehicles..and we also sent the Neon to buy some timbits for us..many people were starting to get hungry..</p>
						<p class="eassy_body_e">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, around 11am, the rest of our crew arrived. Tom and Dave showed up after going off somewhere to hook up the truck to the trailer, and Matt arrived with his vehicle in tow. The first thing that happened once our little parade began was...the road was BLOCKED by construction!! GEEE..this was getting to be pretty annoying! So backup guys...</p>
						<p class="eassy_body_e">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Event number two occured about 15 minutes into the drive..Tom and some others had zoomed ahead of us, and low and behold (just like the PEI trip), a cop..starting to flash his pretty lights at us! Luckily, he only wanted to double check that we had the canoes secured tightly! WHEW!!</p>
						<p class="eassy_body_e">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon, we were headed down the road again..yuppi..Tom's cottage was getting close..so down the 'exit' ramp we went..hehehe....chuckle chuckle chuckle..some people missed it..anyway, we sat there for a good "5 Tom minutes" (equals about 25 minutes in people time)..while we were sitting there, we made good use in time by pumping up Angeline's tires and teasing Aleatha and Fei about weighing down the car ;)</p>
						<p class="eassy_body_e">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally..we got into serious driving after Tom and company returned..</p>
						<p class="eassy_body_e">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next event that happened, was that we drove down the wrong lane! Eventually, we got to the proper location..and everyone immediately began to unload their junk. Took us a good 20 minutes to gather things into piles..and then the girls started to make us some yummy tuna, chicken and ham sandwiches. While we were eating our delicious meal, Tom, YC, Angeline, Jit Chien, Matt's Dad, and Chung Ling (Jason) went to drive the cars down to our put out area. Upon their arrival back, we had already picked, packed and tied down and lined up our canoes. We had four people in one canoe, and one three person canoe, and the rest were two people/canoe. One by one, we heaved and hooed into the water..and slowly everyone was pushed off. Dave and Tom were the last in, but were going to take the lead, while Matt and I stayed behind to "herd the ducklings" (HEHEHEE)</p>
						<p class="eassy_body_e">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the ducklings had some direction problems..so we went really really slowly at first. In the end, we had to do a switcheroo, and when that didn't work too well either, we tied the canoes together. Meanwhile, while we were struggling to catch up to the rest of the gang, they were all enjoying a nice refreshing dip in the clean sparkling lake!! DARN, I missed it!! </p>
						<p class="eassy_body_e">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyway, after a brief hop in and out of the canoe, we were on our way again. The waves were starting to get bigger and bigger. By the time 5:00pm rolled around, we were still about 40 minutes away from our campsite. Sometime before 7pm, Matt and I started to hear Tom's whistle blowing like crazy (Three long blasts = GET INTO SHORE NOW!!), and a whole lot of yelling. Matt and I were somehow positioned so that if we paddled backwards, we'd go to shore. In about 10 minutes, we reached shore, and somehow got out of the canoe. Matt starting to run to find out what happened, while I was there holding the canoe. There were a few moments where I was really worried, what was going on? Was everyone ok? Was my canoe going to somehow get flipped over? My questions were soon answered when Matt came bounding back through the woods. News was, Davin got completely drenched when his and Ricmond's canoe got filled with water, he was suffering from mild hypothermia..ekkk!! After getting his stuff, Matt ran back to try to get Davin warmed up. A little while later, Tom's face peeped around the corner, boy was I glad to see him! He helped me move the canoe further up onto the rocks and we tied it up. When I finally went to see Davin, he was wrapped up in all of Matt's clothing, plus some blankets, and still shivering..poor guy..I felt so bad for him.</p>
						<p class="eassy_body_e">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After seeing him, I figured that we should probably take a count of how many people were on dry land and how many people were out fighting the waves. Angeline, Steven, Chris, Jeff, Fei and Caroline were all out there. The rest, had managed to get to the other side of the bend and were all ok. Angeline and Steven arrived a little while after we started to search for them, but Jeff, Fei, Caroline and my little brother were still nowhere to be seen. I started to get REALLY WORRIED!! </p>
						<p class="eassy_body_e">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, finally, after what seemed like eternity, they came ashore! Ya! Everyone was safe and sound! Tom made the decision that we would camp there that night, luckily we had stopped at a camp site (equipped WITH a TOILET..but no walls). Since darkness was quickly approaching, unloading began quickly. First, the decision of what to eat...steak our original dinner of steak, would take too long, so we swapped Friday's dinner with Saturday's dinner and had hamburgers and hotdogs instead. With some people pitching tents, others starting a fire, and the rest searching for food, things were going well. While eating dinner, we were hunting for some sleeping bags..some poor guys had sopping wet sleeping bags..oh GOSH! Weather predictions were that it was going to be a COLD COLD night...great...</p>
						<p class="eassy_body_e">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our official Fire Keepers (Michael, Davin and Ronald) kept us toasty by rounding up branches of all sorts, especially those that would cause the fire to go up in a huge blaze..</p>
						<p class="eassy_body_e">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Around 11pm, everyone began to look at stars. It was indeed a beautiful view..we all gathered around the water, and found some appropriate rocks to lie down on. Jit Chien even brought some maps of the sky for us to try to identify what star was what. He was our star expert. Dave, Caroline, Matt and myself sat out there for at least 4 hours. During the course of that time, we say so many different shapes: kites, Eiffel tower, a person kicking a ball, equilateral triangles (Caroline's specialty). Around 2am, we started seeing things..like stars moving around in circular motions..that's when we decided to go to bed. </p>
						<p class="eassy_body_e">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next morning, we were up at around 8am..and breakfast had begun cooking! TERRIFIC! We had a great meal of bacon and eggs, plus specially fried potatoes by Steven. Immediately after breakfast (and a backbreaking experience of washing dishes..OWWWW) we started to repack everything up. While doing that, KIND KIND KIND Ricmond and Aleatha, brought our canoe over to the other side where everyone else was...thanks guys! We were out of there by about 1:00pm (my times, are probably really off, I wasn't wearing a watch for the entire trip..), a last minute sweep of the area (boy, I forgot to mention, there were SO MANY MOTHS!!), blast off..into the beautiful clear water..</p>
						<p class="eassy_body_e">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That day, we had an amazing view! Matt and I, as usual, were slow..last off..playing mother duck again..anyway, we enjoyed ourselves, paddled a bit, and just sat back to drink in the beauty. Caroline and Fei were following our ever so lazy example..hehe..once we were nearing the camp site, (we knew this, because everyone had docked their canoes and had started to sit around, swim, etc..), we passed this little area that was blocked off by a bunch of large rocks. On the other side, there was more water...we decided to stop the canoes and go to shore to investigate. 10 minutes into our investigation, we heard a bunch of yelling..telling us to "GET OVER HERE!!"..so we had to cut our visit short, and start moving. While we were having our slow paddle, we also ran into two falcons (well, we guessed they were falcons)..they were HUGE!! We got pretty close to them, and sat there staring for a bit..but not too long, since they seemed to be getting a bit annoyed with us..wouldn't have been a pretty sight to see them angry..</p>
						<p class="eassy_body_e">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We reached our original destination of Red Banks. It was quite a nice place, we pitched our tents "Uptown" while we ate and cooked "Downtown". One of the first things I did after unloading the canoe, was SWIM!!!!! Unfortunately, the water was not as warm and welcoming as it was when they first swam :( But it was still quite refreshing. Shawn, Chung Ling, Victor, Tim and Steven were out there fishing asap. Karen, Chien Ee, Jit Chien and I tried to swim out ..but it was getting rather chilly..so we decided to float around. Later, Karen and I just floated in the canoe..I think I got really dark doing that...shucks! After I got bored of doing that, I sat on the beach with Angeline for a while, then Jeff and Ricmond came along, and we built our "village"..boy..what a funny activity!! Three University students playing as if they are children in elementary school..hmm..nature sure brings out a strange side to us! ;) Other funny things we observed, a flipped over canoe, with hands coming out the sides..hah..and people singing underneath it..it was quite a sight! Ronald, Chris and Michael had their little adventure burring each other in sand. Other people had gone off exploring, some taking little snoozes on the beach, some taking pictures..in general, just having a nice relaxing afternoon. We did eventually have a nice lunch of salad and pasta..yummmy in the tummy!</p>
						<p class="eassy_body_e">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Around 5pm, Tom, Ricmond and Timothy returned from their fetch Tom and Nina expedition..yuppi! We were all glad that everyone was back safe and sound...!</p>
						<p class="eassy_body_e">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That evening, we had a lovely steak and vegetable dinner..unfortunately, the mash potatos took too long, but some of us enjoyed them anyway. Almost immediately after we ate, we went uptown and had SMORES. Now, this was a totally new Canadian experience for some of the Malaysian Students. Let me explain what SMORES are: First, you melt a marshmellow in the fire, then, once melted, stick some chocolate chips in that marshmellow so that the chocolate melts..then, place the marshmellow and the chocolate between two graham crackers..and voila! A SMORE!! I had two, and after that..I thought..TOO SWEET!!</p>
						<p class="eassy_body_e">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Around the camp fire, we had our 'speeches' from the two presidents (well, if you want to count Chung Ling's speech as a speech), plus a Happy Birthday song for the 'Birthday' of Chung Ling..mm...MSS seemed a bit high on sugar that evening..hehehe...</p>
						<p class="eassy_body_e">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gradually, everyone started going back downtown..some of us gathered around the fire, while others put their sleeping bags out down by the water to enjoy another night of star gazing. I chose the fire since the wind was picking up and starting to get quite chilly. We had some interesting conversation that evening...hehe..</p>
						<p class="eassy_body_e">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At about 12:00, it was time to go back uptown again. I had my nightly brushing teeth and washing face routine (some people said that washing their faces were unnecessary since we were out in the wilderness and going to get dirty anyway..mmmm). After Sally and I went on a "Bathroom break" into the dark woods, we laid down and had a star gazing lesson from Jit Chien. He pointed out the milky way to us..it was so beautiful!! I saw so many more shooting stars that night then the first..</p>
						<p class="eassy_body_e">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I fell straight to sleep the minute I went into our tent..but was awoken a little bit when the rest of the girls came in. Angeline said that they were singing or something ...</p>
						<p class="eassy_body_e">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next morning, I found out that some people had slept down by the water ..oh my goodness..it was so cold that night..I thought they were NUTS!! But they said that they were pretty warm..hmm...oh well!</p>
						<p class="eassy_body_e">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Angeline and I joined Tom, Shawn, and Victor for a nice cup of hot chocolate..then headed down to start breakfast. Hunting for the pancake mix was a big chore..out of a huge mess of bags..oh MY! Eventually, we had a line of pancakes, sausages, and hot chocolate begun..mmm mmm good! People slowly trickled down to begin eating our delicious breakfast..we topped it off by 'fried mash potatos' which were extremely good to eat!</p>
						<p class="eassy_body_e">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The weather that day was quite windy, so it was decided that we would get out of camp as soon as possible. We left our beloved campsite at around 1pm.</p>
						<p class="eassy_body_e">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The waves were really choppy..and it started to get increasingly difficult to paddle. It took us about 5 hours just to reach a place that would usually take 2 (again, don't quote me on this!) ..Matt and I were getting quite frustrated after a while..well, perhaps the paddle paddle paddle, eat a little...sit a bit...paddle paddle paddle pattern didn't quite work! When we got close to our destination (the little opening between islands), we saw Chien Ee, Shawn and Sally doing a SOS Dance...I had no idea what they were doing until I asked..and they said SOS..haha..!! Turns out, they had been waiting for us for a good hour...well, gee..the waves were bigger AFTER they got out! No WONDER! :P</p>
						<p class="eassy_body_e">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They had a nice fire going for us when we arrived..but we mostly just sat there and enjoyed our last moments out there..once Wender and Timothy's canoe passed us..we all took off and followed them. Poor them..didn't even have a rest! The waves became much better after we paddled into the path...probably because one of the big chunks of land was blocking some of the wind...finally! The final paddles, took only about 15 minutes..and we were quite reluctant to arrive at land..:(</p>
						<p class="eassy_body_e">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we did arrive, it was time to unload and pack up..what a very sad job indeed. We were just a distance from the US border so Dave and Caroline walked over and got some water from them. We finished our day with a lunch (this was around 5pm) of Mr Noddles and Alphabet Soup..our ncie and strong boys (tee hee hee) packed and tied the canoes..while the gals..tried to get us some nice fish..(unfortunately, turned out empty handed)</p>
						<p class="eassy_body_e">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Around 7pm, we jumped (limped rather) into the assigned vehicles and started to drive. Once out of the lake system, we stopped at a place to eat at Eel River Canteen to eat...thank goodness! This is where we met our first real toilet once again...ahh...civilization...!</p>
						<p class="eassy_body_e">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our trip home was a drive...stop...drive...stop...kind of pattern..since people got really annoyed with our slow moving parade on the way there, we were much more considerate on the way back. So much, that the car I was in (with all 6 canoes) passed by the rest of the parade when they stopped at a gas station..hehe..OPPS!! They only figured it out about 20 minutes after we passed them...heh...but they caught up in no time at all! :P</p>
						<p class="eassy_body_e">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arrived at my house around 10:30pm, by the time we unpacked, pitched and swept out Aleatha's tent..it was getting quite late...and the lack of light made it hard to see whose things were whose..</p>
						<p class="eassy_body_e">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eventually, everything was settled..the last person leaving at 12:30am..poor Tom, Chris, Matt and Dave were still unloading canoes until 1:30am...</p>
						<p class="eassy_body_e">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This trip, was a wonderful experience, with memories that will last me a lifetime. I really appreciate all the hard work that went into organizing and leading this trip. Thank you to Caroline and Sephora, our dedicated President and Vice President! Thanks to Matt and Jeff, our Canoe Transportation guys..your hard work didn't go unnoticed. Finally, Thank you so much Tom, you are certainly one in a million!! A special thank you to your family for allowing us to borrow your time and energy! With all the ups and downs, the overall result came to an UP! What a FANTASTIC TRIP!!!!!!!</p>
