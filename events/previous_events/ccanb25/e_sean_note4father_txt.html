						<p class="eassy_body_e">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You sometimes think that your son is from another planet. The tiny child for which you once changed messy diapers and dried seemingly endless tears has, somehow, suddenly become much bigger. He now speaks to you about strange things that you don’t understand, like baseball scores and computer games. The worst of all is that you speak to him in Chinese, and now he answers you in English. Ten years ago, you took him (or rather, you dragged him kicking and screaming) to the Chinese school you helped to found, but he doesn’t seem to have learned much from it. It seems that, except for his appearance, he is no longer Chinese. Now, you wonder if he cares at all, about where he is from, and who he is.</p>
						<p class="eassy_body_e">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whatever you may think, rest assured that he does think about these things from time to time; but he wonders about you as well. After all, he points out that it was you who decided to come to this country, not him. It was you who decided to cross the ocean from the Far East and begin a new life here. When he’s feeling particularly curious, he may ask you: why did you come here? However, for some reason, you are always at a loss for words to answer. He is beginning to suspet that you really had no idea what you were getting yourself into at that time. You weren’t thinking about him when you came here (he wasn’t even born yet). Probably, you came because of your career and for opportunities. Did you ever imagine what it would be like to bring up children here? Had you ever thought that they might lose their language and their culture? In the beginning, it probably never crossed your mind.</p>
						<p class="eassy_body_e">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Taiwan and Hong Kong now, students are studying their TOEFL books very hard. They all want to come here, and, like you, become Canadians. Their children, or their children’s children, may become like your son, and lose something of their language and culture.</p>
						<p class="eassy_body_e">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ten years ago, you and your friends started this school- the Chinese School- to keep the Chinese language and culture alive. The school has grown up along with your son. He has to admit that it seems you are doing very well in running the school these days. He remembers the very beginning and the undisciplined chaos (he confesses) he gleefully participated in (after all, he was much younger then). Now, he is amazed at how much the school has grown, and how you all yet manage to keep everything (well, almost everything) under control.</p>
						<p class="eassy_body_e">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, we are all Canadians now, and we have to fit in here somehow. So inevitably something of the Chinese in us is lost. Nevertheless, as long as there is the school, we will at least be reminded of who we are, and that there are aspects of this identity which are unique and different. Your son feels some loss by now, not enough to really trouble him, but enough to make him think about it. Someday, perhaps, he will try to rediscover a few things. For now, he is trying to make the best of it here in this country - the one that he calls his home. </p>
