            The Chinese Cultural Association of New Brunswick (CCANB) established in 1977 by few families and soon started a basement co-op Chinese Language School for their own children. Since then, more and more Chinese Canadians and immigrants have joined and helped and it becomes one of New Brunswick's largest and most vibrant communities. Our Chinese Language School has since evolved into a multi-functional educational tool with more than 60 students and a center of our community.

            CCANB opens to all New Brunswickers who love the Chinese culture and language.  It is a member based cultural association. Since its establishment, it has contributed significantly to the cultural and educational experiences to the citizens of Fredericton and New Brunswick. It is our continual goal to provide a warm and welcoming environment for our members and all new comers to our community. It is a large platform to whoever want to show their talents, to add their effort of building better community and to help others.

            CCANB strongly believes in that the integration of the Chinese culture into the multi-culturalism is the right way of preserving, promoting and prefunding our traditional values.  CCANB also strongly believe that our society will be better and better if we keep high spirits, positive modes and contributive attitude.
