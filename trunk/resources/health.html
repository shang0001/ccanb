                            <p>
                            <p>As with many places in Canada, New Brunswick is currently experiencing a shortage of family doctors. Because of this, it can be quite difficult, if not impossible, to find a doctor willing to take on more patients. Ask family and friends if their doctor is willing to take you on, or call 1-866-554-5959 and have your name added to the waiting list. You may also leave your name and contact information on the <a href="http://en.horizonnb.ca/facilities-and-services.aspx" target="_blank">Horizon Health</a> registry. <a href="http://en.horizonnb.ca/find-a-doctor.aspx" target="_blank">The registry</a> was created to establish a database of individuals in this region who need a family physician. Your information will be offered to a family doctor in your area when one becomes available.&nbsp; Hospitals: There is only one hospital in Fredericton.&nbsp; There is also a hospital in a neighboring town called Oromocto.&nbsp; You go to hospital ONLY if you have an EMERGENCY, or if a doctor has ordered a test for you that must be done at the hospital. Wait times for the emergency room in Oromocto would be less than in Fredericton.</p>

                            <p>If you are planning to move to Canada, it is best to purchase private health insurance prior to your arrival.&nbsp; This ensures you will be covered for any healthcare emergency that may arise soon after your arrival. After becoming permanent resident in New Brunswick you will be eligible for <a title="Medicare" href="http://www.gnb.ca/0051/0394/index-e.asp" target="_blank">Medicare</a> coverage.&nbsp; A &ldquo;resident&rdquo; means a person lawfully entitled to be or to remain in Canada, who makes his home and is ordinarily present in New Brunswick, but does not include a tourist, transient or visitor to the Province.&nbsp; You may apply any time after arriving in the province.&nbsp; After applying, you will receive a letter stating the Medicare numbers of each family member, and the date you will become eligible to use the numbers.&nbsp; The cards will arrive in the mail at a later date.&nbsp; An application for Medicare coverage is available from the offices of Service New Brunswick (<a title="SNB" href="https://www.pxw1.snb.ca/snb7001/e/1000/1001e.asp#47" target="_blank">SNB</a>).&nbsp; A separate form should be completed for any dependent who has reached a nineteenth birthday.</p>

                            <h2>What about medical care coverage for refugees?</h2>
                            <p>
                                <p>Essential medical care for refugee claimants, or Permanent Residents who came through a refugee sponsorship program, can be paid for by the Interim Federal Health (IFH) program administered by FAS Benefit Administrators Ltd. (FAS) located in Edmonton, Alberta.&nbsp; All policy and final adjudication is solely the responsibility and at the discretion of Citizenship and Immigration Canada (CIC). The program has been put in place for humanitarian reasons to allow refugee claimants, Convention refugees, humanitarian classes and others under immigration control to receive essential health care. It is not meant to replace provincial health plans and does not provide the same extent of coverage allowed to permanent residents.&nbsp; The IFH program covers essential health services for prevention or treatment of serious medical and dental conditions, as well as contraception, prenatal and obstetrical care. It does not cover all routine medical or dental services.&nbsp; Refugees resettled from overseas including those government-assisted or privately-sponsored are eligible for full benefits under the IFH program until coverage under their provincial health plan begins. Once provincial coverage has started, refugees are eligible for partial benefits under the IFH Program from 12 to 24 months from the time of arrival in Canada.&nbsp; To find out more about the IFH Program call FAS Customer service at 1-800-770-2998 or visit <a title="http://www.fasadmin.com" href="http://www.fasadmin.com/">http://www.fasadmin.com</a></p>
