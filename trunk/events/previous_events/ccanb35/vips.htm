				<h2>Continuity and Steady Growth: celebrating the 35th anniversary of CCANB</h2>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>It is hard to believe that we are celebrating the 35th anniversary of the founding of CCANB. The last major gala performance to celebrate the 30th anniversary of our association seems to have happened only yesterday. How time flies!</p>
				<p>Thinking back at the founding of our association, it was indeed a venture and a great effort made by no more than a dozen Chinese families together with a few scores of Chinese students at UNB. We pulled our energy and resources together in creating the CCANB. From that humble beginning, the association experienced its steady growth in spite of occasional ups and downs. Perseverance has paid off. The association has earned its reputation in our city and province. Our membership has more than quadrupled. Our regular programs and special events have steadily expanded. </p>
				<p>In my humble opinion, there are two major reasons which may explain the success of CCANB. First and foremost are our unity and our effort to work together for the common goal of preserving Chinese culture in our community. The Chinese community in New Brunswick is a microcosm of overseas Chinese community elsewhere. It is a very diverse community due to the legacy of Chinese Diaspora as well as China's turbulent political history in the 19th and 20th centuries. Sharing a common root of Chinese ethnicity, we differ in geographical background, in spoken languages, in political conviction, in economic and professional status, as well as in some cultural traits. However, from the very beginning, we observed a clear principle of working for our broad common goal and setting aside of our divergence. Policy debate and arguments among our members never did serious harm to this principle.</p>
				<p>The second reason for the longevity and prosperity of our association is our dedication to develop harmonious relations with the community at large and our devotion to promote our cultural root within the broader principle of multiculturalism and social cohesion in our adopted country. We have regularly met requests from local school board for presentations to the students in promotion of cross-cultural understanding. We have always taken part in annual celebrations marking Canada's major festivals.</p>
				<p>Notwithstanding our various achievements, there is one major drawback or disappointment in regard to the functioning of our association. For thirty-five years we have been operating on borrowed or rented facilities for our regular activities and special events. Repeated fund-raising campaigns were launched to improve the financial foundation of CCANB. However, the limited resources of a relatively small Chinese community in our city have prevented us from securing a permanent site to operate our Chinese school as well as carrying out other cultural and sports programs for our young people. If our members may have one "New Year's wish", it will most definitely be the acquisition of a premise to accommodate our activities. Let us all hope that such a wish will become a reality before our next major celebration!</p>
