						<p class="eassy_body_e">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 1977, people from all walks of life have had the opportunity to learn the Chinese language. A Chinese school in Fredericton, N.B. was quickly developed through the eagerness of the hard-working members of the Chinese Cultural Association. An extended thank-you must be given to them for their time and efforts.</p>
						<p class="eassy_body_e">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A typical day at the Chinese school would begin with a one-hour class. Adults and children would be divided into their respective groups. The decision was influenced by the children’s ages and their choice of learning either the Mandarin or Cantonese dialect. During the hour, teachers of the younger students concentrate on the writing of Chinese Characters. The teacher of the adult class provided a special time for conversation.</p>
						<p class="eassy_body_e">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second hour was separated from the first by a fifteen-minute intermission. The deserving children were rewarded with cookies and drinks while the adults stuck to the coffee and donuts. The second hour was left for the teacher’s imagination. Some would indulge their students in arts and crafts. Others continued with the teaching of Chinese characters or conversation. During this time, the students were eager to leave their seats since the third hour was dedicated to extra-curricular activities or, in simple terms, the “unwinding of the children”.</p>
						<p class="eassy_body_e">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the third hour, the instruction of judo and dancing skills were provided for the boys and girls. At this point of the afternoon, the children’s excitement and spirit was almost observable. Those adults who could not be young at heart learned Chinese painting. Most were inspired by the beauty of the art. Thus, the typical day at Chinese school ended in a flash.</p>
						<p class="eassy_body_e">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All of the student’s skills in the language and arts were frequently made known through various occasions such as adjoining concerts with other cultural organizations. The public seemed to be most impressed with the school’s annual year-end concerts. The elaborate dances, songs and skits would make the final gesture of the enthusiastic administration and teachers.</p>
						<p class="eassy_body_e">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Presently, in 1988, these ideas and actions still exist within the Chinese society. In order to maintain the spirit and interest forever, we must give much support to the dedicated organizers. Each little effort is accepted by the Association with gratitude and is remember for many years to come.</p>
