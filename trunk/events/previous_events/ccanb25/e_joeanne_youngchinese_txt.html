						<p class="eassy_body_e">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am a twenty three year old medical student. I was born in Canada to parents originally from China. Last summer, I was fortunate enough to return to my roots. As part of the third-year curriculum of the medical program, each student has two elective periods, each a month long, to gain clinical experience in the field of his or her choice. Many of my classmates chose to stay in St. John’s, but a few went to different parts of the World like India and England.</p>
						<p class="eassy_body_e">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Setting up an elective in China was by no means an easy task because no medical student from Memorial University had ever traveled to that country. We tried many options, some of which were successful. Fortunately, my parents were able to arrange the elective through a Chinese scholar who had been studying at UNB a few years earlier. The arrangements took a few months to set up and were finalized one month prior to the starting date.</p>
						<p class="eassy_body_e">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I arrived in Shanghai on June 12, 1986 and went to the Rui Jin Hospital the next day. I had arrived in the middle of Shanghai’s most humid and rainy season. I was certainly not accustomed to this, and even by the end of my stay in Shanghai I had not fully adjusted. Air conditioning is virtually unheard of in people’s homes, and even the large hospital wards which hold 30-40 people do not have such luxury. Electric fans are still reserved for the wealtier while most of the common people resort to the use of bamboo fans.</p>
						<p class="eassy_body_e">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My place of stay was approximately a 30-minute walk from the hospital. I used to wake up at 6:00am and leave for the hospital before 6:30am. Already by then, the street was a bustle, with people on their way to go to work, to schools or to grocery stores. It was quite a sight to see those small crowded apartments with families all on the sidewalk brushing their teeth, feeding the children, and washing their clothes.</p>
						<p class="eassy_body_e">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Buses and bicycles were the most common form of transportation accessible to the normal Chinese. Buses were dilapidated and overcrowded. People pushed and shoved to assure themselves of a place on the bus. There was no room for movement of any sort once you were on. Walking along the street, one could easily see that hygiene continues to be a problem in China. It was common sigh to see people spitting on the road. Young children were permitted to urinate on the sidewalks and littering is becoming a major problem. Two words, in my opinion, sum up life in this large city - dirty and crowded.</p>
						<p class="eassy_body_e">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hospital I worked for was a large 2000 bed-care hospital. It provided a variety of services including emergency, surgery and internal medicine. I worked for three and a half weeks on the surgery service and three weeks on the internal medicine service. The hospital facilities were, in my opinion, 20-25 years behind those of the Western hospitals. Operating equipment was old but still functional. Sterilization techniques were certainly not up to par. In China, the equipment is washed, sterilized and reused whereas in Canada plastic equipment is used and disposed of.</p>
						<p class="eassy_body_e">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hospital wards were divided into male and female sections. Each ward had 25-30 beds. At the front of each bed was a wooden chair. Usually, a family member sat there to take care of the patient with regard to feeding, bathing, etc. This is in contrast to Western hospitals where nurses are responsible for those needs. Chinese medicine is held in high regard in China, and was ever practiced in the hospital I worked at.</p>
						<p class="eassy_body_e">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My stay in China was certainly no where near what I had expected, and it was an unforgettable experience. Perhaps, we may say that man will never know the hardships of the Chinese until he is placed in their difficult environment as I was.</p>
