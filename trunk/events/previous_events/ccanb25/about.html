<p class="bodytext">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This CD is a photographic record of the activities of the Chinese Cultural Association of New Brunswick for the past 25 years, and it is produced to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the association. </p>

<p class="bodytext">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We would like to thank the members of the association for contributing the photographs.  Carol Chow has spent considerable effort in producing an earlier album of similar nature, and we have included here many of her collections.  Jar-Yee Tan has spent endless hours identifying the names of people on the pictures.  She is also the one who designed and produced this CD. We are also grateful for the City of Fredericton for a grant to partially fund this project. </p>

<p class="bodytext">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you find errors in the names or can help us name those yet unidentified, please let us know.  The photographs are identified by numbers within each section and the peoples are also numbered. </p>
<p class="bodytext">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Please enjoy.</p>
<br>

President,<br>
Chinese Cultural Association of New Brunswick, 2001-2002.</p>
